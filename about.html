            <h2>Our Story:</h2>
            <p>Co-Make Started in 2018 as a neighborhood project to report issues to our local HOA. It quickly became a great tool for folks who wanted to be involved in community improvement but were unable to attend weekly meetings. We soon found that many of the issues being reported fell outside the jurisdiction of the HOA, but we were able to easily streamline the process to work with local government and other agencies to direct requests to the correct department. As its popularity increased, its users expanded beyond our neighborhood. Quickly, the entire city was involved and local government agencies now have direct access as requests are directed automatically. We now proudly service over 100 US cities of all sizes. Don't see yours yet? It's on the way! As we've expanded, we've created a process to seamlessly transition local governments in any part of the country to be able to receive requests from Co-Make. Welcome to community involvement!</p>
